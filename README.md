# ClassifySongGenresFromAudio

# Overview 
This project focused on developing a machine learning classifier to distinguish between two music genres: Hip-Hop and Rock. The classifier was trained using a dataset with track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify), including features like danceability, energy, acousticness, and tempo.

## Objective
The primary goals of the project were to:

1. Explore the dataset to identify trends and factors relevant to genre classification.
2. Implement and evaluate machine learning algorithms to classify music genres based on track features.
   
## Data Exploration
Using Python libraries pandas and seaborn, the dataset was thoroughly explored. This involved:

1. Data Loading: Imported and preprocessed the dataset.
2. Visualization: Created various plots to uncover trends and relationships between features and genres.

## Results
The classifiers were evaluated using accuracy and other metrics. The results indicated the effectiveness of the implemented models in distinguishing between Hip-Hop and Rock genres.

- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 85.2%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 80.7%
